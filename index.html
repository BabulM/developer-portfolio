            <h2>Serving those people who are orphan</h2>
            <p>Orphan is who have no parents.They live in tbe society as a lower class.They have no chance for doing
                education,geting medical treatment etc.Overall,they live their livelihood under poverty.That is why i
                want to serve the people those are orphan.When i serve them,i feel very much proud in my mind.I pray to
                Allah that i can always serve the orphan people.</p>
